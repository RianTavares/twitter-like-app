## What does it do
This project is part of a front-end challenge. 
The core function is to list values sent by an Observable as a Twitter-like structure/style and manage them, such as like/dislike them, list liked tweets, and delete them. You can check the full description of the challenge in [this pdf](./src/assests/pdf/Twitter-like_application.pdf).

## Style Guide
I used a linter library (ESLint) with the Airbnb Style Guide, one of the most popular style guides available on Github, to guide the development through a set of best practices and guidelines for keeping the code quality.

## Local setup with Node

1. Download or Clone the project and extract it
2. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) (v 16) and install it.
3. Run `npm install` in the project's root folder
4. Start the app in the development mode via command line `npm start`
5. The project now is running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Running with Docker

1. You should first have[ docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in your machine
2. Run `docker-compose up -d --build` in the project's root folder
3. The project now is running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
4. To stop the docker container just run `docker-compose stop` in your terminal

## Running Tests
#### To run simplified preview tests:

1.  Run `npm run test` in the project's root folder

#### To run tests seeing their respective descriptions:

1.  Run `npm run test-verbose` in the project's root folder
