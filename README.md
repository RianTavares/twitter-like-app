## What does it do
This project is part of a front-end challenge. 
The core function is to list values sent by an Observable as a Twitter-like structure/style and manage them, such as like/dislike them, list liked tweets, and delete them. You can check the full description of the challenge in [this pdf](./src/assests/pdf/Twitter-like_application.pdf).

## Fast setup (CLI)

1. Download or Clone the project and extract it
2. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/it/) and install it.
3. Run `npm install` in the project's root folder
